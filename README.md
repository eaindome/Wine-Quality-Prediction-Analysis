# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Analysis
Analyzing the wine quality dataset and making prediction analysis
This repository contains for 4 files; 1 dataset and 3 notebooks.
They are:
1. winequalityN.csv which is the dataset used for this prediction analysis
2. Wine Quality Prediction Analysis which is the main notebook
3. Wine Quality Analysis which contains all undertaking experiments to choose appropriate visualizations and models
4. Wine Quality Prediction which is my first take on this challenge
5. Wine Quality Prediction Analysis with unsupervised learning which contains additional unsupervised learning methods. The unsupervised learning methods are not yet explained though, will be handled in another dataset.
